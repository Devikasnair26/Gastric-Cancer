# Gastric-Cancer

This study investigates gastric cancer data to uncover the bimodal gamma distribution. 
Analyzing the dataset through statistical tests confirms its bimodal nature resembling a 
gamma distribution with two distinct modes. The process involves merging datasets, fitting 
distributions, bootstrapping for parameters, simulating data, and comparing distributions. 
Future research aims at early detection, biomarkers, personalized treatments, resistance 
mechanisms, and immunotherapy. This research anticipates transformative advancements in 
gastric cancer management, emphasizing personalized care strategies.
